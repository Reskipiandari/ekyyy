   <h2> style="color :blue">A Briep History of HTML</h2>
   <h3 style="color:blue ">1993-present</h3>
   <p>The first version of HTML was wirtten by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993.since then,there have been any different versions of HTML. The mos widely used version throughout the 2000`s was<b>HTML 4.01</b>, which becamean official standard in december 1999.</p>

   <p>Another version ,<b>HTML</b>, was a rewrite of html as an xml language. xml is a standard markup language  that is used to create other markup languages.hundreds of xml languages are inusey today,including gml (geography markup language), <b><i>mathml,musicml</i><b/>, and <b><i>rss</i></b> (realy simple syndication). sinceeach of these languages was writen in a comon language (XML),their content can easily be shared across applications. this make Xml potentialy very powerful,and it's no suprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML) XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is very similiar to HTML,but has stricher rules.strict rules are necessary for all XML languages, because without it, introperability between aplications would be imposible. you'11 learn more abaout the differences between HTML and XHTML <u style="color:blue">in unit 2.</u></p> 
   <p>
     most pages on the web today were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTL 1.0. however, in recent years, the W3C (in collaboration with another organization, the <u style="color:blue">WHATGW</u>), has been working on a brand new version of HTML, <b>HTHL5</b>. currently (2011),HTHL5 is still a draft  specipication, and is not yet an official standard, however, it is alredy widely supported  by browers and other web,enabled devices,and is they way of the future. therefore,<b>HTML5 is the primary language taught in this course</b> </p>
   <p>
   	The following table shows a list of many of the types of content that can be added to eb pages using different versions of HTML. in the early days of the web, HTML (version 1.2) was very simple,but over time new versions were relased that added more and more features. still if web designers wanted to add content or features that HTML didn't support,they would have to do so with non-standard proprietary technologies such as adobe flash,these technplogies would require users to browser plug-ins, and in some cases meant that certain users would be unable to access the content (for example,iphones and ipads don't support flash).
